# News-research-tool

### 1. Project Initialization
Objective: Build an AI-powered news research tool that processes article URLs, splits text, embeds data, and retrieves relevant information.

### 2. Data Ingestion
Load Articles:
Use TextLoader to load plain text files or documents.
Use UnstructuredURLLoader to extract content from web article URLs.
Ensure proper handling of unsupported formats using fallbacks (like BeautifulSoup or requests).

### 3. Text Preprocessing
Split Text:
Use CharacterTextSplitter for basic splitting into chunks based on a fixed character count.
Use RecursiveTextSplitter for intelligent splitting by considering sentence and paragraph boundaries to ensure better context retention.

### 4. Embedding and Indexing
Generate Embeddings:
Use OpenAI embeddings or another embedding model to convert text into vector representations.
Build FAISS Index:
Store embeddings in a FAISS index for efficient similarity-based searches.

### 5. Retrieval Mechanism
Query Processing:
Implement a retriever mechanism that searches the FAISS index for documents most relevant to a user query.
Response:
Retrieve the top-k most relevant chunks of text.
Optionally, display source URLs alongside retrieved content.

### 6. Streamlit Deployment
Frontend Development:
Create a Streamlit interface with the following components:
Text box for entering URLs.
Query box for inputting user questions.
Display area for showing results (text and source links).
Backend Integration:
Use Streamlit to connect the user interface with the backend pipeline (loading, processing, embedding, and retrieval).
